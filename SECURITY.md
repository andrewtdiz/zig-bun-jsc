# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The project is under heavy refactoring and only the `main` branch receives fixes.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please email `security@zigbridge.dev` with a detailed description of the issue, proof-of-concept if possible, and the operating system/toolchain you used. We will acknowledge new reports within five business days, keep you informed about remediation progress, and coordinate a disclosure window that works for everyone involved. If email is not possible, open a private security advisory via GitHub instead of filing a public issue.
